        "desc": "Live up to your inner voice, you Amazonian warrior! What matters most today is not how everyone else is appeased by you, but how you hold your ground amidst opposing views, contradictory situations and really get to the core of what you believe to be true and righteous in the moment, Aries. Stand up for your beliefs as the cosmos stands firmly behind you, okay?",
        "cosmic_tip": "Manifest your deepest desires uninhibitedly."
    },
    "Taurus": {
        "desc": "If faith feels like a task, try again, Taurus. Your dreams whisper in your heart and the reason you experience delays is perhaps a call for a need for healing and clearing, not only your subconscious but also your ancestry. Ground your energy, connect with the core of the Earth, practise some breathwork, even try walking barefoot feeling a connection with the ground you walk on, to anchor your energy, ideas and inspirations.",
        "cosmic_tip": "A multifaceted situation requires a multifaceted approach to life."
    },
    "Gemini": {
        "desc": "Your unwillingness to let go may be the invisible hurdle in your path, you divine being!

    "Cancer": {
        "desc": "Balancing your masculine and feminine energy involves you also stepping forward to nurture your body, as you do your mind and soul. Your past life gifts are activating themselves in creative ways ushering an inflow of abundance and you are undergoing a ‘rites of passage’, Cancer. The question is - are you willing to let go of old dramas and habits that hold you back?",
        "cosmic_tip": "Go within to take action."
    },
    "Leo": {
        "desc": "Courage and valour can only take you this far, Leo. Your next level in life depends on how tactfully you balance action with reflection, chaos with peace, mind with the heart.

    },
    "Virgo": {
        "desc": "It is your time to anchor magical frequencies onto this planet, Virgo, and you must do it by embracing your pain points as you do celebrate your strengths. In your love for the animals, you leave the world a kinder place, and a specific message for some from your furry friends in heaven is to play as much or perhaps even more than you work, because that is the true purpose of life.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Live your purpose each day by being your own Guru."
    },
    "Libra": {
        "desc": "Your heart wants to sing a song that your mind may find ironic, and that my dear friend is the beauty of life! A broken heart needs nurturing, and what has left may have been part of a divine orchestration of higher goals your soul may have chosen to grow through. Rapid karmic encounters and endings are here for you, and while they may feel ecstatic and painful, they are much needed. Accept whatever flows into your life, with complete faith that your Angels are watching over you. ",

    },
    "Sagittarius": {
        "desc": "Flexibility, patience and faith in the cosmos makes a perfect recipe for an empowered life, Sag. As your familial relationships heal, especially with nurturing figures in your life, you emerge stronger, more connected with yourself. Manipulation no longer holds power over you, as you now gain new found clarity and perspective in your life. Let your pure intentions lead the way forward.",

    "Capricorn": {
        "desc": "Self-love leads to self-acceptance, and self-acceptance leads to unrestrained living.

    },
    "Aquarius": {
        "desc": "There may be a conflict between your heart and your mind, Aquarius, and the only way out is to trust that you can lean in on the support of your closest ones today. If the voice in your head says you can’t do something, it’s time you listen closely to the soft voice in your heart and pay attention to the advice it doles out.

Welcome a deeper understanding of life, and it’s workings, also, remember to shed the load of irrelevant ‘expectations’ from your shoulders.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Choosing peace is as much a choice as choosing conflict."

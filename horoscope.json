    "Aries": {
        "desc": "You have this magical ability, Aries - to zoom out and float above things while you also are busy doing stuff. And this is your portkey to the cosmic treasures. Today try making note of what ideas come to you as you drift into that space that lets you see things from an objective standpoint. Instead of fiercely safeguarding your material resources, consider distancing yourself from all that feels like it is out to take advantage of you and then begin your journey into creating a life you envision with full gusto. When you detach yourself from the fear of losing, you vibrationally align with the frequency of wonder and creation.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Choose a new direction and trust the crumbs that follow."
    },
    "Taurus": {
        "desc": "May be the answers you are seeking are not found when you struggle alone. May be, just may be your prosperity lies in creating shared resources. Taurus, humans are social animals for a reason - they are not meant to build by themselves. Just as it takes a team to construct an apartment, it takes a team to even run one. And if you have been struggling to make ends meet - even if emotionally, you must force yourself to observe where the scales are imbalanced and where you feel you could use a helping hand. There is no shame in asking for help - because not everyone is great at everything and that is where we complement each other.",
        "cosmic_tip": "The Universe is asking you if you are ready to build a community or keep marching ahead like a martyr."
    },
    "Gemini": {
        "desc": "Your wishes are being fulfilled at topspeed, Gemini so close your eyes, breathe in the sweet smell of success and perhaps even pinch yourself to remember that this is actually happening! What began as a seed is now blooming into a mini tree, perhaps a money making one for some, and an abundant feeling one for others - It doesn't matter! What matters is that you must keep walking through all the doors that are opening up for you, think your way through things in the long term, but keep taking small actionable steps today, tomorrow and day after to levitate towards your biggest dreams yet.",
        "cosmic_tip": "You are ready for some cosmic magic."
    },
    "Cancer": {
        "desc": "Have you been so focussed on material success that you have forgotten what makes you truly feel alive, Cancer? Re-serenade your life, realign your goals, and most definitely revisit your relationships. Be open to new opportunities, embrace new possibilities, and be willing to put in the work. You are still learning the ropes of life, and you will keep evolving until the day you die. So resist giving into the stubbornness of your ways, and simply be open for today. Let this be the day that helps you receive and recover all that is seemingly lost, but in reality is waiting for you to pick up once again.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Big, happy changes lie ahead for you."
    },
    "Leo": {
        "desc": "Ditch conflict for fellowship, competition for co-existence to turn the tables in your favour, Leo. You are not stuck or hung upside down. You are simply willing to move in new directions not knowing what that fully implies as yet. Trust the cosmos, yourself, your life and your inclinations to guide you forward in the most meaningful ways for you. The situation will improve, things will shift, focus your mind on the brightest possible outcome, and choose gratitude for the massive support system in your life - this includes your team of light.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Every no is a cosmic redirection to an aligned yes!"
    },
    "Virgo": {
        "desc": "Your ability to see through illusions gives you a flair for spotting opportunities too, Virgo. Use your mental agility to strike a sharp balance between your thoughts, emotions and words that flow from your mouth in order to achieve the previously unachievable. You have it in you to pool in resources, time and energy with those on a similar wavelength, and you certainly have your social support system solidly in place. So instead of fearing the worst about your material security, hustle, rustle and make hay - because the sun is shining down upon you.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Look for signs and keep marching ahead."
    },
    "Libra": {
        "desc": "Your present day may feel uncertain, Libra, but really remember that it is a mere blip in the vast timeline of your life and your soul. You are born to live an unrushed life - one that feels beautiful and abundant, especially because of your house ruler - Venus. Now, go embody all those Venusian traits of Love, harmony, beauty, creativity and spice it up with your witty social skills to excavate your hidden leader that rests in the lairs of  your heart. To ring in success in your life, you must go back to your enterprising ways.",
        "cosmic_tip": "The seeds you sow, will bear fruit. They may take time, but they will definitely blossom."
    },
    "Scorpio": {
        "desc": "Think, feel, act. Your mantra is that simple this week, Scorps. When you think and then think some more, you risk going down a slippery rabbit hole. When you are all heart, you risk over-romanticising life. When you walk the middle path, you learn to fall in love with your ideas, finding ways to bring them to life with your passion and love infused touch. You also sift through the junk very efficiently helping you mark your steps ahead at an even and achievable pace. Mondays mark the beginning of a week in most cultures, only to remind us that there are 168 hours that lie ahead of us that can be utilised in a million different ways, including caring for ourselves.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Communicate your goals to yourself and the cosmos clearly. "
    },
    "Sagittarius": {
        "desc": "You’ve worked hard for worldly pleasures and they are yours, Sag. The wheel of fortune is turning in your favour, and you are building your wealth one bigger gold coin at a time. You have an army of helpful people surrounding you, engulfing you with their support and care. You also are immensely blessed with a magical touch - so mindfully touch all you wish to turn to gold, but remember that not all that is valuable glitters, just as not all that is gold is valuable. Become aware of your incessant thoughts and fall in love with life once again.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Value people over opportunities to create lasting wealth."
    },
    "Capricorn": {
        "desc": "You wished upon a star and here you are thriving with your family and loved ones, Capricorn. But tell us what hold you back from truly sharing more of yourself? From truly being present and from actually being there for your core circle apart from providing for them? What if just for a short while you handed over the steering wheel of your over ambitious life to your Angels and focussed on being present and offering your most authentic , loving self to all you did - be it nurturing your relationships, your goals or even yourself? You might just land up in your most blissful space taking the shortest, most creative route available. Your need to be seen may simply be your overlooked inner child asking for attention and there are a million meaningful ways to fill that void. ",
        "cosmic_tip": "Forge, don’t force. Your time will ultimately arrive, give time some time."
    },
    "Aquarius": {
        "desc": "You’re off to a bluey start this Monday, Aquarius with a severe hangover, metaphorically or in actuality. The only solution to wade through your day is to take the plunge believing that the cosmos has your best interests in mind. What will happen if you derail your mind front he monetary aspects of life just for today while you immerse yourself in doing what you are offered, perhaps even trying to enjoy it a bit? Nothing. You may realise how much fun you had during the day, or you may also realise that this is not for you. But either way, you will be offered a godsent opportunity, that will fructify in the next couple of weeks, even if it feels insignificant in the  moment.",
        "cosmic_tip": "Reach a truce between your mind and heart to find your way back to life."
    },
    "Pisces": {
        "desc": "You may already be at the end of a thread in your head while you continue to join forces, work together and build something up, Pisces. And as contradictory as it sounds, you are building in your mind as well, just not what you are currently building with your hands. Keep pushing forward no matter how slowly you progress because it is not how fast you get somewhere that matters, but how you get there that is of utmost importance.",
        "cosmic_tip": "It may just be the time to wait things out."
